# ListComplexityTest-Challenge-B1-C410
## Prove the time complexity of the LinkedList add and remove operations   
1.﻿﻿Add a new class called ListComplexityTest to the Analysis project  
2.﻿﻿The main () method of ListComplexityTest should create a new LinkedList of Integer objects and generate N random integers < N*10, storing each in the LinkedList as it is generated.  
3.﻿﻿For each integer generated, measure the time taken in nanoseconds to store the element in the LinkedList and obtain the total time taken to add the elements.  
﻿﻿4.Now generate a further N random integers in the same range and attempt to remove an element of that value from the LinkedList, again calculating the total time to remove.  
5.﻿﻿Repeat for values of N of 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000 elements and report for each value of N, the total time to add, the average time to add, the total time to remove and the average time to remove.
